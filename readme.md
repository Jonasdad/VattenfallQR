VattenfallQR is a web application developed for Vattenfall's I-lab environment. The application generates a QR code for a "smart plug" that measures energy consumption of individual appliances. 
A user can generate a QR code and scan it to get access to the web application that presents the energy usage of an appliance over 24 hours, past week or past month. 
NOTE: This was developed as a prototype and is meant to be used locally.
